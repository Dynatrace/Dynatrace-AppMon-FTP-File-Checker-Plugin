## Usage Example

This plugin can be useful for detecting when a given file does or does not exist on a file system that is accessible by FTP. This can be useful when a file existence or absence is used as a trigger
for the beginning or completion of a batch job. The resulting measure can be plotted, displayed as a Traffic Light, and alerted upon via an action. Below is an example of showing the status of the
file and showing an alert condition via a Traffic light when the file is not found.
